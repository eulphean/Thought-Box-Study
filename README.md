# Thought-Box-Study
Inspired from my 2021 project [Thought-Box](https://vimeo.com/657286422), entire family of Thought-Box characters to life in an interactive infinity room. Built with React-Three-Fiber and Blender, the model is compressed using Draco, and texture packed with Blender to optimize loading times.
